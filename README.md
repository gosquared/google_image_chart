# GoogleChart

Simple wrapper to Google Chart. As the service will be switched off in
2015, this has been mostly put together for legacy reasons. It's easier
to drop a gem from a service rather than delete code (and specs)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'google_chart'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install google_chart

## Usage

Check the examples directory. To run a specific example:

    $ ruby examples/google_chart.rb

NB: you will need to have all gems in the `development` group installed.
